# Intro to Git - by @PandelisZ

These are my slides used to run GitHub Campus Expert workshops at various hackathons
and universities. This is my own personal take on introducing people to git at a mid to advanced level.
This is the way I would want to be taught it. There is no prior knowledge required. It has
a healthy dose of theory also so it is equally valuable to people with prior Git knowledge 
that havent dove into the inner working of the technology.

Feel free to tinker or adapt these slides to run your own workshops!
This repository is available as MIT but an attribution would be nice.
You can contact me through the issues if you need help or advice.
